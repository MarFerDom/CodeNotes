CodeNotes
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is a compilation of a few snippets that I find useful for using
different libs or not so daily-base code. It allowed me to practice
while testing the caveats of each lib/property of python and coding in
general.

## Install

``` sh
not supposed to be used as a lib
```

## How to use

The idea here is to find some code snippet with some explanation for
every ocasion on a single place.

## TO DO

1.  Do it as a single project development case (maybe a game?);
2.  Include tests for each component of the project;
3.  Improve layout.
